## *LinkFury*
LinkFury is an API that brings together Instagram and urlscan.io to scan for malicious links without having to leave the Instagram app. This will help reduce the attacks on Instagram accounts through phishing.
We will achieve this through cloning an Instagram website then using it to test our theory. We intend to use LinkFury as an extension that can only access links sent on Instagram to ensure privacy in other chats.

## *How to run the project*
LinkFury will come in as Instagram is directing the user to leave Instagram and go to the site of the link. It will then scan the link and alert the user if it is malicious before he or she goes to the site the link is directing them to.
